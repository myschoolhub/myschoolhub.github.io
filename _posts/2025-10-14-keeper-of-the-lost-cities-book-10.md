# Keeper of the Lost Cities – Book 10 Update

**Release Date and Title (Tentative):** Simon & Schuster’s official listing for _Keeper of the Lost Cities_ #10 gives
a publication date of **November 5, 2026** (UK/Children’s). No official subtitle or name has been
announced – the book is currently referred to simply as _Keeper of the Lost Cities 10_. In fact, the publisher’s
announcement (AP News) in 2021 described the 10th book as “currently untitled”. (Earlier press had
slated Book 10 for 2023 as the final volume , but that schedule has since slipped.)

**Plot Details:** At this point there is _no official synopsis_ for Book 10, but interviews hint at the core story
threads. Messenger has said Book 10 will involve the fallout of Keefe’s journey through Humanland. In a
late-2024 Publishers Weekly interview, she confirmed that “there are some really big secrets that Keefe is
keeping” which will come out in Book 10. (She noted that the events of the new Book 9.5 ( _Unraveled_ ,
from Keefe’s POV) must be woven into Book 10’s narrative to make those revelations feel organic .) In
short, Book 10 is expected to focus on Sophie learning what Keefe discovered, and the emotional
implications for their relationship. Messenger has promised the book will reveal “all of the secrets that
readers have been dying to know since book one” and deliver an “epic” conclusion.

**Series Conclusion:** Book 10 was **originally announced as the series finale**. In the 2021 Aladdin/S&S
announcement, Messenger said the 10th volume would conclude Sophie’s story and reveal all remaining
mysteries. (She explicitly called it the “final conclusion” of the saga .) In recent remarks she has
likewise stressed winding down the series and answering big questions. However, she has hinted
that if necessary she may extend the series beyond ten books to cover everything (no formal 11th book is
confirmed). In short, Book 10 is intended as the big finale, though Messenger is keeping options open in
case any major plotlines require further volumes.

**Delays and Updates:** Book 10’s release has been **delayed** from earlier plans. The author announced in
March 2023 that she was expecting her second child, which pushed the timeline for writing the book (no
new date was given). In early 2024 Shannon Messenger also released a special novella ( _Unlocked_ ,
Book 8.5) and then Book 9.5 ( _Unraveled_ ) in November 2024, further delaying the main series’ conclusion. As
of mid-2025 no firm new release date for Book 10 has been announced. However, the paperback edition of
_Unraveled_ (out Nov 11, 2025) is confirmed to include a “bonus sneak peek” (first chapter preview) of Book 

. This suggests Book 10 will follow sometime after late 2025 – consistent with the late-2026 listing
on S&S’s site. In summary, Messenger and her publisher have confirmed that Book 10 _will_ be released
(eventually) but have not yet named it or given a final date. Watch for the planned sneak-peek in _Unraveled_
(Nov. 2025) and publisher announcements later in 2025 or 2026 for full details.

**Sources:** Official publisher and news reports and author interviews were consulted. Release plans come
from Simon & Schuster’s site and AP News/Spectrum (2021). Author comments (Interviews/
Q&As) describe story clues. Retail listings (Barnes & Noble) confirm the _Unraveled_ paperback (Nov.
2025) will include a preview of Book 10. All cited information is up-to-date as of Fall 2025.
