2025 and 2026 are shaping up to be another insane two year for anime. Between returning favorites, fresh hits, and sequels that might actually break the internet, here’s a list of ten anime you *need* on your watchlist.  

---

## 10. **Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc**
The continuation we’ve been waiting for — the Hashira are stepping up, and Tanjiro’s about to go through hell (again).  
**Why watch:** Top-tier animation, emotional storytelling, and a finale that’s going to destroy us all emotionally — guaranteed.

---

## 9. **Solo Leveling: Season 2 – Arise**
Jinwoo’s back, stronger, darker, and way cooler. The first season set a new standard for game-based anime, and this one’s about to level it up even more.  
**Why watch:** Power fantasy done right. Every episode looks like a movie trailer.

---

## 8. **Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters (Part 2… of Part 2… maybe?)**
Yeah, we’ve said “final” a lot, but *this time* it might actually end.  
**Why watch:** Because you’ve come this far. You deserve closure. Even if that closure is trauma.

---

## 7. **Jujutsu Kaisen: Season 3 – Shibuya Aftermath**
After the madness of the Shibuya Arc, things are about to hit even harder. Expect character deaths, power-ups, and MAPPA working overtime again.  
**Why watch:** Because JJK is peak dark shonen right now. It’s fast, emotional, and hits like a cursed brick.

---

## 6. **Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End – Part 2**
Peaceful, melancholy, and heartbreakingly beautiful. This show makes silence feel louder than explosions.  
**Why watch:** It’s not about fighting — it’s about *feeling*. Easily one of the most mature fantasy anime of the decade.

---

## 5. **My Hero Academia: Season 7**
The heroes vs. villains war is finally peaking. Deku’s done being nice, and Shigaraki’s chaos is out of control.  
**Why watch:** Long-term payoff for years of buildup. You’ll cheer, cry, and probably yell at your screen.

---

## 4. **Oshi no Ko: Season 2**
The idol industry never looked so bright — or so dark. Aqua’s revenge plot continues, and every episode feels like a gut punch wrapped in glitter.  
**Why watch:** It’s brutal, emotional, and surprisingly real about fame and identity.

---

## 3. **Blue Lock: Season 2**
Soccer, ego, and more screaming than a rock concert. This show turns teamwork into a mental warzone.  
**Why watch:** It’s shonen adrenaline injected straight into your veins.

---

## 2. **The Apothecary Diaries – Season 2**
Maomao’s back to solve palace mysteries and outsmart everyone in sight.  
**Why watch:** It’s clever, funny, and unlike anything else airing. Maomao’s brain > everyone else combined.

---

## 1. **Chainsaw Man: Season 2**
Denji. Power. Blood. Trauma. Repeat.  
**Why watch:** Because this is *Chainsaw Man*. It’s chaos, art, and emotional carnage all at once — and it’s finally returning in 2025. Expect Twitter to explode.

---

### Honorable Mentions:
- **Spy x Family: Season 3** – wholesome chaos continues  
- **Mashle: Magic and Muscles** – the dumbest, funniest magic parody ever  
- **Kaiju No. 8** – *literally* big monster energy  
- **Medalist** – emotional underdog sports anime that deserves more love  

---

### Final Thoughts:
2025 and 2026's lineup looks wild — every season’s going to have something worth watching. Whether you’re into emotional fantasy like *Freiren* or violent absurdity like *Chainsaw Man*, there’s no wrong pick here.
