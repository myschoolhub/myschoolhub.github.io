If you’re just starting out in coding, **Python** is your best friend.  
It’s free, powerful, and doesn’t treat you like you need a PhD to print “Hello World.”

## Why Python Rocks
- **Readability** – You can actually understand your own code a week later.  
- **Community** – If you get stuck, someone on Stack Overflow has already cried over the same issue.  
- **Libraries** – Want to make games? Websites? AI? Data charts? Python’s got libraries for *everything*.  
- **Cross-platform** – It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even a Raspberry Pi if you’re into that.

## The Broke Student Starter Pack
You don’t need a fancy computer or paid software:
- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Type:
  ```python
  print("I’m officially a coder.")
Boom. You’re coding. No subscriptions. No scammy courses. Just you and pure logic.

## Where to Go Next
- Web dev: Learn Flask or Django.

- Games: Try Pygame.

- AI: Play around with libraries like transformers or openai.

- Automation: Write scripts that do your homework (jk… mostly).

🧠 Hot take: You don’t need to be “smart” to code — you just need to be stubborn enough to Google the same question 12 different ways.
